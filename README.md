# conwayjs
For the final project in my Human-Computer Interaction class, I challenged myself to jam an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in vanilla JavaScript. Hitting the e key allows users to play or pause the simulation, so they can edit individual boxes. The next step for this project would be "deactivaing" cells in order to improve performance, so the simulation can maintain a constant speed over time (it slows down when the field of play becomes too large).
